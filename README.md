# C++ Journey
This is my journey to re-learning C++.Between the time I studied it at university and now its has evolved so much that I just can't look here and there on the web to catch up. This repo contains some containers of the STL reimplemented from scratch for learning purposes using the recent features introduced with C++11 & C++14 versions.
So far I've (partially) reimplemented:
* [vector](projects/vector)
* [List](projects/List)

The README will be updated as I progress in my journey.
